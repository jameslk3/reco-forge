# How to run our project

### Clone git repo (recommended):
- Run "cargo run --example description" or "cargo run --example item"

### Install crate:
- Add the following line to your Cargo.toml file: reco-forge = "=0.1.1" or run "cargo add reco-forge@=0.1.1"
- Follow the documentation [here](https://docs.rs/reco-forge/0.1.1/reco_forge/) to write your own code or simply copy the example
- Either create your own JSON file following the requirements or use one in the git repo under sample JSON
- We recommend sample-json/movies/movies_clean_mini.json because it provides the highest quality descriptions and is also small (large files take very long)
